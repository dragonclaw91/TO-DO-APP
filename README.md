this is my TO DO list app created over the weekend.

## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

the biggest problem to overcome was making sure the information got appended in an aesthetically pleasing way. solved mostly by trial and error in css and jquery.

## Prerequisites
express.js
node.js
pg

## Installation

Create a database named your database name,
The queries in the tables.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. I recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install
Run npm start in your terminal


## Usage

this is a very user friendly application, just type into the field, and click the add button to add tasks. After that, the user can mark tasks as complete or incomplete. The app will automatically add tasks with a not done status. Once completed, it will sort the tasks not completed on top, and completed on bottom. Finally, delete simply deletes the task. All changes are made directly to the database.

## Built With
this project is built with postgres,postico,node.js,express.js,jquery,and javascript.
